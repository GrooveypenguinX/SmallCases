# SmallCases
A mod for SPT-AKI that adds a few unique small variants to many of the cases in Tarkov. And also a Fannypack!



This mod adds a a few unique cases to the game to make the early game a little less tedius! This mod features five new cases:

- Small Ammopouch: A small pouch that has a 3x2 internal grid to store ammunition. (Prapor sells this at level 1)

- Small Docscase: A small docscase with a 2x4 internal grid to store documents, money, and keycards. (Therapist sells this at level 1)

- Small Keychain: A small keyring with a 2x3 internal grid to store keys. (Therapist sells this at level 1)

- Lunchbox: A luncbox with a 3x3 internal grid to store your food and drinks. (Jaegar sells this at level 1)

- Medicine Pouch: A medicine pouch with a 3x4 internal grid to store all your meds. (Therapist sells this at level 1)

All of these cases are added to traders, and added to assault, usec, and bear loot.


And also has a unique new backpack, the Fannypack!

- Fannypack: A slick way to hold all these new cases, or anything you want really. (Ragman sells this at level 1)

What sets the fannypack aside from the rest is it can go in the third special slot! The fannypack now works as a (janky) extension to the player inventory, allowing you to see half of the inventory of the fannypack without opening it. 

NOTE: THIS IS INTENDED JANKINESS.
The way BSG coded these slots is the same exact way a backpack or chestrig slot works, whn you put the item inside the inventory appears. Because of where those slots are, placing the bag in slot 1 or 2 would overlap slot 3. By putting it in slot 3, you won't be overlapping any slots but you WILL have half of the Fannypack overlapped by the inventory screen.

You can still open the bag inventory by double clicking on it/right click and open. I wish I could move the inventory of the Fannypack slightly to the left, but that's beyond my means lol. So for now, we get half of a new backpack added to our inventory.

The Fannypack is added to usec, bear, pmcbot, and assault bots.

Big shoutout to Jehree's custom case framework for doing all the legwork! All I did was tweak a few things to add special slot support (thanks to jbs4bmx Special Slots), and ended up making the case framework support multiple cases so this mod didn't need to be 6 separate folders lol.
